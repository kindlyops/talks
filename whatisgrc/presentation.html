# What and Why

* .large[Governance: collection of capabilities driving principled performance]

* .large[Risk: Market, Credit, Operational]

* .large[Compliance: externally imposed standards]

???

Often compliance standards are vague or lag technology so much that the
challenge is interpreting the standards in a responsible and balanced way.

Risk is a very overloaded word, even worse than security.
In addition to market risk, credit risk, might also think of liquidity risk.
Often security people lose sight of the fact that cybersecurity is only one
component of operational risk. Correctly placing cybersecurity as a component
of operational risk is important for making balanced business decisions.

This opens the door for folks working on cybersecurity to use more mature
and structured ways of measuring and prioritizing risk. The old
RED/YELLOW/GREEN arbitrary rankings are not sufficient

---

# Defining Operational Risk

## RISK = Loss Event Frequency x Loss Magnitude

- A measurable event

- No such thing as "a risk"

- a **loss event** is a **threat**  acting on an **asset** causing an **effect** 

- Effects are CIA
 - Confidentiality (data breach)
 - Integrity (fraud)
 - Availability (theft, DOS, outage)

???

There is no such thing as "a risk", there are amounts
of risk associated with scenarios over a period of time.
Typically we would set the time to 1 year.
Example scenario would be laptop loss/theft over a year.
You know how many laptops, how much travel, how many were
lost last year: in 5 minutes 
you have some of the necessary inputs to calculate the
probabilities of loss over the next year.

What is NOT risk?

* A control deficiency: untested recovery process, weak passwords
* A threat community (disgruntled employees, cybercriminals)
* An asset (internet facing web servers)
* An attack that does not cause loss (successfully defended, or asset of no value)
---

# What are losses?

## FAIR six forms of loss

* Productivity (business interruption)
* Replacement (capital assets)
* Response (crisis management, forensic investigation)
* Fines &amp; Judgements
* Reputation
* Competitive Advantage

---

# Watch out for heatmaps

## red flag for poor analysis

* cannot add risk scenarios together - how much risk if you add 2 red risks?
* range compression - just barely red vs very red
* doesn't allow for expression of uncertainty
* cannot calculate reduction in risk per dollar spent on security

## Qualitative labels as summaries of ranges is fine

# "You can outsource your operations, but you cannot outsource your risk"

  US Department of Homeland Security Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [Awareness Briefing on Chinese Cyber Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/event/chinese-cyber-activity) [(slides)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/c3vp/Chinese-Cyber-Activity-Targeting-Managed-Service-Providers.pdf)

???

In February Kindly Ops attended this government briefing reviewing a sustained
campaign by the chinese government against Managed Service Providers. During
the briefing they referenced the January 2019 WorldWide Threat Assessment
of the US Intelligence Community published by Daniel Coats, director of national intelligence, which stated "Cyber is the top threat to national security".

The WHY is when a breach occurs at any company, we want to be sure that
commercially reasonable defenses were in place, and that we had proactively
analyzed and managed the risks, not just done the minimum mandated for
compliance without considering organization specific risk scenarios.

# STRATEGY

???

All the moving parts are too big to fit inside any one experts head.
We don't want to waste time and money overprotecting things, the
security vendors will happily play off the growing concern and hype.

While technical details of cybersecurity are changing rapidly,
we have managed operational risk in the face of grave threats and
significant uncertainty as long as we have had insurance companies.
need to use good tools to help us make structured judgements.

Some useful models and frameworks

???

Often friction between technology builders, product and business owners,
and security and governance teams. Starting with empathy makes the
rest of the process much more efficient.

It is common for companies to work on this baseline
from a top-down and bottom-up approach at the same time.
Next will describe some of the control and risk frameworks that are 
useful to accelerate development of a security program.

Has your organization done initial scenario-based risk analysis based on prioritized
threats?

Do you have metrics or KPIs such as FORCE that encourage a learning organization?

# NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF)

???

This is the top down cybersecurity framework

good list of best practices around cybersecurity
and risk management that organizations can follow as a guide.

Can be used as a maturity model, where activities can be ranked on
ordinal scales 1 to 5. This is what many firms are doing enterprise-wide.

Important: NIST CSF does not define what cyber risk is, and does
not provide guidance on how to assess what areas have the biggest probable
loss exposure or prioritizing based on risk reduction.

# CIS Top 20, AWS Foundations Benchmark

???

This is the bottom-up control framework.
Prioritized set of controls that protect against known cybersecurity
attack vectors. Informed by consortium of industry experts and prioritized
based on analysis of attacks across the industry.

# AWS Well-Architected Framework

Security

Operational Excellence

Reliability

Performance Efficiency

Cost Optimization

???

12 years of cloud operations experience distilled into best practices
across 5 areas of focus. Consider that many of the attacks that
happen in the industry are against companies running on AWS, there
is a great deal of detailed knowledge about how to run securely.

# FAIR (Factor Analysis Information Risk)

https://www.fairinstitute.org/

???

Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) has emerged as the standard Value at Risk (VaR) framework for cybersecurity and operational risk.

Originally developed at an insurance company, then published as
an Open Group Standard, and now being adopted rapidly across
the industry. Complementary to and compatible with CSF.

This is something that being rapidly adopted across industry, and provides a
way of adding structure to any discussion about controls.
