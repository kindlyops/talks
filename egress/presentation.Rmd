# GOALS

* .large[Build/operate a fintech API with no EC2 servers (no patching, no SSH access)]

* .large[Traffic pattern is relatively low frequency, each request is important (hitting a cold start on a request to transfer funds would be unacceptable)]

* .large[Integrate with existing technical control schemes to build trust with other groups in the new system and technology]

---

# TRANSLATION TIME

- No EC2 Servers means Lambda functions. Also possible - ECS services running on Fargate

- Since each request is important cold start times are crucial

- Building an API translation layer with existing control schemes

  - IP based whitelist at backend service
  
  - Need IP based whitelist capability on our service frontend
