# What and Why

* .large[Governance: collection of capabilities driving principled performance]

 * Example: requiring code reviews
 * Example: Forced 2 week vacations  [FDIC](https://www.fdic.gov/news/news/financial/1995/fil9552.html)

* .large[Compliance: externally imposed standards]

 * UL listing for electrical appliances
 * PCI standard for card processing
 * FIPS 140-2 for crypto modules
 * Whether your workers are contractors or employees

* .large[Risk: Market, Credit, Operational]

 * Great introduction in the free and open source book [_Financial Analytics Using R_](https://bookdown.org/wfoote01/faur/)

???

One way to think about governance is that it's typically about setting
up forces that are going to act on a situation where you don't know
any of the details or the people. It as to be vague enough that it's
possible for people to do the right thing. Code review, imagine trying
to make a control that was going to make things safer regardless of
technology, language, or team size. Imagine trying to make a rule that
was going to prevent fraud in companies that haven't been formed yet,
using technologies that haven't been invented yet!

In highly technical fields, compliance standards can be vague or lag technology 
so much that the challenge is interpreting the standards in a responsible and
balanced way. Healthcare and cybersecurity in particular, over prescriptive

The only reason we care about governance and compliance is because we care
about risk. Risk is a very overloaded word, even worse than security.
In addition to market risk, credit risk, might also think of liquidity risk.
Often security people lose sight of the fact that cybersecurity is only one
component of operational risk. Correctly placing cybersecurity as a component
of operational risk is important for making balanced business decisions.

This opens the door for folks working on cybersecurity to use more mature
and structured ways of measuring and prioritizing risk. The old
RED/YELLOW/GREEN arbitrary rankings are not sufficient

# Defining Operational Risk

## RISK = Loss Event Frequency x Loss Magnitude

- A measurable event

- No such thing as "a risk". Probability of losses associated with scenarios over a period of time.

- a **loss event** is a **threat**  acting on an **asset** causing an **effect** 

- Effects are CIA
 - Confidentiality (data breach)
 - Integrity (fraud)
 - Availability (theft, DOS, outage)

- Effects have a magnitude, or cost

???

There is no such thing as "a risk", there are amounts
of risk associated with scenarios over a period of time.
Typically we would set the time to 1 year.
Example scenario would be laptop loss/theft over a year.
You know how many laptops, how much travel, how many were
lost last year: in 5 minutes 
you have some of the necessary inputs to calculate the
probabilities of loss over the next year.

What is NOT risk?

* A control deficiency: untested recovery process, weak passwords
* A threat community (disgruntled employees, cybercriminals)
* An asset (database of customer records)
* An attack that does not cause loss (successfully defended, or asset of no value)
---

# What are losses?

## FAIR six forms of loss

* Primary or direct losses
  * Productivity (business interruption)
  * Replacement (capital assets)
  * Response (crisis management, forensic investigation)
* Secondary or indirect losses
  * Fines &amp; Judgements
  * Reputation
  * Competitive Advantage

???

Sometimes it's useful to split these into two buckets, primary and secondary
losses. Primary losses incurred directly by the organization, secondary losses
imposed later from forces outside the organization (market, government)

We are NOT trying to completely eliminate losses! Trying to make better decisions
about them, manage them.

Can you imagine an investor deciding that they were going to pursue a zero-losses
investment strategy? They might do it, but they would also have zero gains.

---

# How to express the measurement?

## Probability of loss for a scenario

* Probability of loss event
* Probability of magnitude
* Not a single point ordinal number!
* Example from [TidyRisk Evaluator](https://evaluator.tidyrisk.org/reports/evaluator_risk_analysis.html)

???

often get hung up on measurement and expert estimation. How can an estimate be
a measurement?

Two super important points
* measurement is reduction in uncertainty. Lets talk through an example
* when we record an estimate, we want to INCLUDE the uncertainty so that it
  doesn't get lost when we combine multiple estimates. If you want to go deep
  on this, recommend the book Bayesian Methods for Hackers, it's on github.
* Also recommend Doug Hubbard book, how to measure anything in cybersecurity risk

???

This is an example from the example free and open source TidyRisk
toolkit by David Severski. A common way to review the expected losses
in a year. This is an example aggregating 56 different risk scenarios.

The probabilities can be added up so you get a similar curve whether
looking at a single scenario or rolled up for the entire enterprise,
or split out by category, etc.

This example is showing the 80% likelihood of losses exceeding a certain
level. So 80% another way to think about that is 4 out of 5 years. So
based on the estimates that went into this example risk analysis, 4 out
of 5 years they are expecting at least $4.2M in losses.

The immediately useful thing about this is that you can have a business
conversation around a budget. And you can focus your risk reduction
efforts in the right spot! Maybe the right thing to do is reducing threats,
but maybe the right thing to do is reducing magnitude of loss!
Would you spend $5 million to prevent $4M in loss?

# heatmaps - red flag for poor analysis

* cannot add risk scenarios together - how much risk if you add 2 red risks?
* range compression - just barely red vs very red
* doesn't allow for expression of uncertainty
* cannot calculate reduction in risk per dollar spent on security
* Use online tools to get a feel for building a model from range estimates
* Qualitative labels as summaries of ranges is fine

https://www.fairinstitute.org/blog/heat-maps-dont-support-iso-31000
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266666768_The_Risk_of_Using_Risk_Matrices
https://medium.com/guesstimate-blog

???

One of the most crucial concepts to take away here is that measurement is
reduction in uncertainty. Experts making subjective estimates is still useful,
but we want to be careful to capture the uncertainty in those estimates so that
when we combine estimates to build a model, we don't throw away information and
make gross math errors. There are solid, well known math techniques for working
with uncertainty (probabilities), and counting the number of "Red" threats is
actively harmful. Cyber security should be expected to learn the same basic
numeracy that we expect from finance folks.

# "You can outsource your operations, but you cannot outsource your risk"

  US Department of Homeland Security Cyber and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) [Awareness Briefing on Chinese Cyber Attacks](https://www.us-cert.gov/event/chinese-cyber-activity) [(slides)](https://www.us-cert.gov/sites/default/files/c3vp/Chinese-Cyber-Activity-Targeting-Managed-Service-Providers.pdf)

???

In February Kindly Ops attended this government briefing reviewing a sustained
campaign by the chinese government against Managed Service Providers. During
the briefing they referenced the January 2019 WorldWide Threat Assessment
of the US Intelligence Community published by Daniel Coats, director of national intelligence, which stated "Cyber is the top threat to national security".

The WHY is when a breach occurs at any company, we want to be sure that
commercially reasonable defenses were in place, and that we had proactively
analyzed and managed the risks, not just done the minimum mandated for
compliance without considering organization specific risk scenarios.

# STRATEGY

???

All the moving parts are too big to fit inside any one experts head.
We don't want to waste time and money overprotecting things, the
security vendors will happily play off the growing concern and hype.

While technical details of cybersecurity are changing rapidly,
we have managed operational risk in the face of grave threats and
significant uncertainty as long as we have had insurance companies.
need to use good tools to help us make structured judgements.

Some useful models and frameworks

Often friction between technology builders, product and business owners,
and security and governance teams. Starting with empathy makes the
rest of the process much more efficient.

It is common for companies to work on this baseline
from a top-down and bottom-up approach at the same time.
Next will describe some of the control and risk frameworks that are 
useful to accelerate development of a security program.

Has your organization done initial scenario-based risk analysis based on prioritized
threats?

Do you have metrics or KPIs such as FORCE that encourage a learning organization?

Build empathy starts with this presentation, helping people understand the bigger
picture rather than expecting them to react perfectly to ever-increasing tensions.

# Baseline, top-down 
# NIST Cyber Security Framework (CSF)


???

This is the top down cybersecurity framework

good list of best practices around cybersecurity
and risk management that organizations can follow as a guide.

Can be used as a maturity model, where activities can be ranked on
ordinal scales 1 to 5. This is what many firms are doing enterprise-wide.

Important: NIST CSF does not define what cyber risk is, and does
not provide guidance on how to assess what areas have the biggest probable
loss exposure or prioritizing based on risk reduction.

# FAIR (Factor Analysis Information Risk)

https://www.fairinstitute.org/

???

Factor Analysis of Information Risk (FAIR) has emerged as the standard Value at Risk (VaR) framework for cybersecurity and operational risk.

Originally developed at an insurance company, then published as
an Open Group Standard, and now being adopted rapidly across
the industry. Complementary to and compatible with CSF.

This is something that being rapidly adopted across industry, and provides a
way of adding structure to any discussion about controls.

The privacy work is particularly interesting because it's applied to inviduals, not organizations.
The way you model loss for individuals is super interesting compared to organizations.
