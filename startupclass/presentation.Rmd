# do I have to?

- A good idea is not enough

- A great product is not enough

- No matter your business model, the founder needs to be able to raise awareness.
]

???

Most new founders that I've met are allergic to marketing and sales,
they are very excited about talking to customers and building a great
product or delivering great services but feel jaded about marketing and
sales.

After being on the recieving end of a barrages of sales tactics, it's easy
to start wanting to avoid "salesy" stuff.

If you aren't mindful about this, you can shoot yourself in the foot by
keeping people from learning about what you are doing and why they should care.

# stop<br>selling<br>me!

???

There is a big difference between trying to manipulate someone into a
decision that is neutral or bad for them vs genuinely trying to help people.

It wasn't so long ago that I didn't even have the language for different categories
of sales and marketing activities in order to decide what I wanted to use or avoid.

Thought it would be helpful to share pointers to some things that have been
useful for me in my own journey.

# Different kinds of marketing

1. Direct response marketing
2. Brand awareness

???

Much of what we find distasteful is direct response marketing, where
someone is trying to get you to buy something right now or sign up for something.

Much of what we find useful is when someone teaches us or helps us solve a problem,
and we don't mind if we are aware that the person helping us is associated with
a brand that has products and services for sale.

# 4 Sales conversations

Idea from Blair Enns of Win Without Pitching.
https://2bobs.com/podcast/mastering-the-value-conversation

1. Probative - prove your expertise
2. Qualifying - prototypical sales
3. Value - determining what value you can create
4. Closing

???

It is so freeing, removes so much stress to categorize this way.
Which conversation are we having?
If it is the probative conversation, I am not going to
qualify, I am not going to close.

# Building expertise

Philip Morgan's analysis of how rapidly different activities
build trust http://trustvelocity.com/

1. Frequent publication
2. Research that generates IP
3. Speaking engagements
4. Formalize IP  - package expertise to be usable by non-experts

???

This is a program I've been working through the last 6 months,
and daily publication is surprisingly hard and surprisingly helpful.

# Video

???

Video can convey sincerity, authenticity, and
helpfulness in a way that is hard to match in
written form.

Videos can be transcribed and turned into blog posts.
