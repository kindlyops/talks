# CSA REVIEW

- Purpose: review results

- Process: highlight findings, answer questions

- Payoff: clear understanding of results
]

???

Nobody is ever excited about having yet another meeting.

We care a lot about making sure people get both a big picture of
how the company is doing in terms of overall trajectory with
security, as well as specific prioritized details about current
state and technical findings.

Purpose, process, payoff.
