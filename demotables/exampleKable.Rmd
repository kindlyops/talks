## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can make a table like this:

```{r routes, echo=FALSE}
routes <- tribble(~VERB, ~URI,
                  "GET", "/something/fake_banners(.:format)",
                 "POST", "/something/fake_banners(.:format)",
                  "GET", "/something/fake_banners/new(.:format)")

routes %>%
  kable("latex", booktabs = T) %>%
  kable_styling(latex_options = "striped") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = T)
```

Some stuff.
