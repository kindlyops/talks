This is a friendly introductory level presentation for people who are not developers but are interested in incorporating best practices from data science teams into risk analysis work. Executable notebooks like RMarkdown and Jupyter have opened up a new world of reproducible data science and journalism. These notebooks are plain text, version controllable, diffable, and inherently remixable - a perfect fit for infecting an organization with quantitative risk analysis skills. We'll look at example notebooks with Colaboratory, Jupyter, RMarkdown, and share lessons learned introducing quantitative risk analysis techniques to a fintech startup owned by a global bank.
