# trying to make nice reports

???

At first we used remarq.io, which is a paid web service
designed for consultants to be able to make nicely formatted
reports without wasting time. Remarq is created by a single
developer running a small business, very very nice. Behind the
scenes it uses Pandoc, great customer service. Exports PDFs to
Dropbox smoothly, and got up and running without installing anything.

# what if things were<br>...less terrible?

???

Eventually got tired of trying to collaborate and revise reports inside a textarea
on a web page. Remixing elements from different reports also became tedious.

we ended up using google docs for collaborative editing, then painstakingly copy/pasting, then trying to fix formatting again and again.

Missed having version control - Google Docs has some versioning but not good enough

Had an entirely separate workflow for generating graphs which were then included as images
into our reports.

# Time to learn<br>R Markdown!

???

Finally worked up the nerve to start figuring out R Markdown
- At this point none of us knew R
- none of us knew LaTeX or pandoc
- wanted to version control our changes and work in plain text
- wanted to use ggplot
- read a Tufter book, wanted more control over house style
- wanted to integrate the source data and R code for graphing more tightly
- had grand dreams of integrating into a web application at some point

# working<br>together

???

R Markdown seemed promising, and RStudio was cool, but as we tried to trade back and
forth between 3 people working on putting together a big report, it was impossible
to keep our R environments in sync. When one person spent a couple days getting
something added to the report, the next person would not be able to get things
working in order to continue.

---

# compilereport utility script

R glue code for invoking knit and generating PDF from RMarkdown

```bash
exec R -e \
"rmarkdown::render('report.Rmd', output_file='output.pdf')"
```

Docker container that has the exact LaTeX customizations and R packages that we need

custom graphics for report cover pages

`docker-compose` wrapper that makes it dead simple to grab the container and generate the report

???

The Docker images were derived from the rocker project which already had RStudio
bundled up into docker images.

---

# docker-compose.yml simpler invocation

```yaml
version: '2'
services:
  report:
*    image: kindlyops/reporter:big-roboto
    working_dir: /docs
    volumes:
      - .:/docs
    command: [./compilereport]
```

???

So this is a little helper config file which makes it easier to run a command
inside a docker image, build/pull the docker image, mount volumes, etc.

So the way it works is this specifies a docker image, the docker image
has R, the needed R packages, any extra fonts.

The source .Rmd file and source data files are in the local directory,
docker volume mounts are used to expose the local files inside the docker
container, and the output files are written back out to the host machine.

This was worked well, but too much was hardcoded in the report.Rmd
Wanted to be able to use a template and feed in some different
data files from different projects/customers to generate customized
graphs with standard formats.

---

# compilereport utility script

```r
#!/usr/bin/env Rscript

suppressPackageStartupMessages(library("optparse"))

option_list <- list(
     make_option(c("-t", "--template"), action="store", 
         default="report.Rmd", help="The file to use"),
     make_option(c("-d", "--data"), action="store",
*        default="input.csv", help="The input data file"),
     make_option(c("-o", "--output"), action="store", 
         default="output/output.pptx",
         help="The output data file to create")
     )

opt_parser = OptionParser(option_list=option_list)
options <- parse_args(opt_parser)

*rmarkdown::render(options$template, output_file=options$output,
*                  params = list(data = options$data))
```

???

This is using Rscript as the shebang, and uses the optparse R package
to process command line arguments to the script. From the perspective
of the person running the command, they don't need to know that it's `R`.

Allowing the input.csv, template file, and output file to be
specified on the command line made things much more flexible.

This was work we did when connecting up the publishing pipeline
to our web application, so that we could trigger report generation
from the app and have a background worker job generate the reports
and publish them.

---

# passing parameters into R Markdown!

```yaml
---
title: "An Report"
output: 
  powerpoint_presentation:
    reference_doc: template.pptx
params: 
*   data: "input2.csv"
---
```

???

Note the params section that knitr parses when processing R Markown,
this lines up with the parameter we defined in the `compilereport` Rscript cli
---

# Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
FROM rocker/rstudio:3.4.3

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y zlib1g-dev libproj-dev xzdec gnupg \
    && tlmgr init-usertree
RUN tlmgr install roboto \
    && install2.r --deps=TRUE remotes \
    && install2.r --deps=TRUE tinytex \
    && install2.r --deps=TRUE formatR \
    && install2.r --deps=TRUE tidyverse \
    && installGithub.r rstudio/rmarkdown
```

We build this image and tag it, and then reference the image
from the docker-compose file. Everyone gets the same versions
of the R libraries and other components.
---

# Future plans

## stuff we want to improve

Make the Docker images smaller!

Connect to GitHub actions so that a report is compiled automatically
when new revisions are pushed to master? Really want to invoke knit
when pushing to GitHub pages branch instead of jekyll.

Experiment with interactive graphs for exploring complex data

Figuring out integration between R and Python in order to support use of Colaboratory notebooks - jupytext and reticulate

Non-CLI subprocess way of calling into R code from Go code?

Generating custom RMarkdown notebooks on the fly and exporting them to users on demand.
